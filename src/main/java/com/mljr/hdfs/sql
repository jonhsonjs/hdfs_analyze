#1、统计一级目录大小
select joinedpath, sumsize
from
(
select joinedpath,round(sum(filesize)/1024/1024/1024,2) as sumsize
from
(select concat('/',split(path,'\/')[1]) as joinedpath,acctime,filesize,owner
from default.hdfs_info
)t
where joinedpath != 'null'
group by joinedpath

#2、统计二级目录大小
select joinedpath, sumsize
from
(
select joinedpath,round(sum(filesize)/1024/1024/1024,2) as sumsize
from

group by joinedpath

order by sumsize desc

#3、筛选出所有文件中小于1K的文件的个数，按照用户分组
SELECT owner, count(1) as small_file_num
  FROM (SELECT (case filesize < 1024 WHEN true THEN 'small' ELSE 'large' end)
  AS
  relative_size, modificatetime, owner
  FROM
  hdfs_info WHERE is_dir="0") tmp
  WHERE relative_size='small' GROUP BY owner;


#4、筛选出每个用户所拥有的文件数量以及文件大小，按照用户分组
select owner, count(1) num_of_files,round(sum(filesize)/1024/1024/1024,2) Total_Size_GB
 from
 hdfs_info
 where
 is_dir="1" and acctime < modificatetime
 group by owner order by Total_Size_GB;
